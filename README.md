# ENV_File_Creator

This repository contains a utility designed to simplify the management of API keys and environment variables, particularly for AI/ML development, and a script to streamline the Git repository setup process.

## Purpose and Reasoning

Managing API keys and environment variables can be cumbersome, especially when working with multiple services (e.g., OpenAI, Google, Ollama) and across different projects. This utility aims to centralize and secure your API keys, making them easily accessible while keeping them out of your codebase.

The `git_setup_menu.py` script further enhances the developer experience by automating common Git commands, making it easier to initialize a new repository, add files, commit changes, and link to a remote GitHub repository.

## Files in this Repository

- `DR_ENV_Creator.py`: This is the core utility for managing your API keys. It allows you to:
    - Add new API keys for various services (e.g., OpenAI, Google, Ollama).
    - List all stored API keys.
    - Update existing API keys.
    - Delete API keys.
    - Export API keys to a `.env` file for easy use in your projects.
    - Set up Ollama tokens.

- `git_setup_menu.py`: This script provides a menu-driven interface for common Git operations, including:
    - Creating a `.gitignore` file to exclude sensitive information and unnecessary files from your repository.
    - Initializing a new Git repository.
    - Adding files to the staging area.
    - Committing changes with a custom message.
    - Creating a `README.md` file.
    - Linking your local repository to a remote GitHub repository and pushing your code.

- `.gitignore`: This file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. It's pre-configured to exclude sensitive files like `api_keys.db`, `.env`, Python cache files, virtual environments, and IDE-specific files.

- `api_keys.db`: (Generated by `DR_ENV_Creator.py`) This SQLite database file securely stores your API keys. It is excluded from version control by `.gitignore`.

- `.env`: (Generated by `DR_ENV_Creator.py`) This file contains your exported environment variables. It is excluded from version control by `.gitignore`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed.
- Git installed.

### Setup and Usage

1.  **Clone the repository (if you're setting up on a new machine):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Davis782/ENV_File_Creator.git
    cd ENV_File_Creator
    ```

2.  **Run the Git Setup Menu (Optional, but recommended for new repositories):**
    This script helps you initialize your Git repository and set up basic files.
    ```bash
    python git_setup_menu.py
    ```
    Follow the on-screen prompts to:
    - Create a `.gitignore` file (Option 1).
    - Initialize Git repository (Option 2).
    - Add files to staging (Option 3).
    - Commit changes (Option 4).
    - Create a `README.md` file (Option 5).
    - Link and push to GitHub (Option 6).

3.  **Run the Environment Creator Utility:**
    This script allows you to manage your API keys.
    ```bash
    python DR_ENV_Creator.py
    ```
    Follow the on-screen prompts to:
    - List all keys (Option 1).
    - Update a key (Option 2).
    - Export keys to `.env` (Option 3).
    - Add a new key (Option 4).
    - Exit (Option 5).
    - Setup Ollama (Option 6).

## Security Considerations

- **`.gitignore`**: The `.gitignore` file is crucial for preventing sensitive information (like your `api_keys.db` and `.env` files) from being committed to your Git repository. Always ensure these files are listed in your `.gitignore`.
- **Local Storage**: API keys are stored locally in an SQLite database (`api_keys.db`). While this keeps them off remote repositories, ensure your local machine is secure.
- **`.env` File**: When you export keys to a `.env` file, this file is also excluded from Git by default. This is the recommended way to load environment variables into your applications.
